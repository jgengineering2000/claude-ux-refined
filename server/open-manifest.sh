# Ensure the AUR doc server is running, then keep the Alt+D keybinding pointed at
# it. Installed into a project's .claude/ by install.py; invoked by the
# "Ensure doc server" VSCode task, which Alt+D runs BEFORE opening the browser.
#
# Why the two-phase design: a keybinding that calls `simpleBrowser.show` directly
# races the folderOpen auto-start task — press Alt+D before the server has bound
# (or after it died) and Simple Browser shows connection-refused. Running this
# health-check first guarantees something is listening before the browser
# connects.
#
#   1. Resolve the port (.claude/server.port, else $CLAUDE_DOC_PORT, else 7432).
#   2. If nothing answers on that port, start server.py detached and wait for it.
#   3. Sync the Alt+D keybinding's URL to the resolved port.
#
# Step 3 exists because server.py scans upward when its preferred port is busy,
# so a port baked into keybindings.json at install time can go stale and never
# self-correct. Because VSCode binds a keybinding's args at key-press time, a
# port CHANGE takes effect one Alt+D later (this run rewrites the file; the next
# press opens the new port) — in steady state, where the port is stable, the URL
# is always correct.
#
# Idempotent: server.py refuses to double-bind, and step 3 is a no-op when the
# URL already matches. Safe to run on every Alt+D.
